            Kazakhstan is a state in Central Asia, which used to be part of the USSR. It stretches from the Caspian Sea in the west to the Altai Mountains in the east, where the border with China and Russia runs. Alma-Ata is the largest city and an important trade center of the country. Among the sights of the city, it is worth noting the Ascension Cathedral of the Russian Orthodox Church, built under Nicholas II, and the Central State Museum of the Republic of Kazakhstan, thousands of exhibits of which allow you to get an idea of the history of the state.

        <p class = "Kaspi">The Caspian Sea is the largest closed body of water on Earth, which can be classified as the largest drainless lake or as a sea â€” because of its size, origin, depth, salinity, and also because its bed is formed by oceanic crust.</p>
